# Kmeans-Clustering-in-Loan-Prediction-Data
The model evaluation is done using a K-Means algorithm. K-means algorithm is defined as a algorithm in which main objective of this is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective Centroid of clusters.

# Here are following steps for algorithm:

1. Choosing the number of cluster “k”
2. Select “k” random points from the dataset as centroids
3. Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid
4. Again compute the centroids of newly formed clusters
5. Repeat the steps 3 and 4 until no change in clusters
6. Stop the process
